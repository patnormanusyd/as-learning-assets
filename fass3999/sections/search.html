<h2>Creating a research question</h2>
<div class="ic-flash-info" style="width: 100%;">
<div class="ic-flash__icon" aria-hidden="true"><i class="icon-info icon-Solid"></i></div>
<strong>Activity:</strong> Having read the information below, write down a possible answerable question or questions in relation to your own focus.&nbsp;</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-trbl border-round" style="width: 70%; margin: 0px 10%; padding: 10px 5%; background: #f5f5f5;">
<p><strong>Can I just type a question or part of a sentence into a search box? e.g. What is Bitcoin?</strong></p>
<p>It depends.&nbsp; You can - and for a simple, common question with a basic answer Google will try to provide you with that information.</p>
<p>For the most part, however, the sources you are looking for won't contain those questions or sentences written in the way you will enter them.&nbsp; &nbsp;Instead, you need to consider the main terms that would be located in the sources you're looking for.</p>
<p>If you don't have a question - just some themes or topics - you could enter those or you could try to frame a question first and then draw out the key concepts or terms.&nbsp; This will not only help your searching, it will help you to get to the heart of what you are trying to research.</p>
</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the scoping search, you'll have a broad idea of what you want to investigate. This makes searching for focused information challenging. Like we mentioned above, if you search a database for broad questions like <em>'what is bitcoin?'</em>, you will find thousands of irrelevant articles, highlighting the importance of formulating a focused research question.</p>
<p>Research questions can be incredibly specific, but topics that are broader in scope may require you to ask a range of different questions to answer the topic as a whole. Your first step in doing a comprehensive search is to establish a clearly defined and focused question or topic. A clearly defined question will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guide your search strategy</li>
<li>Focus your literature search</li>
<li>Determine the parameters of your search - what will you include and exclude?</li>
<li>and inform you analysis of what you find - what do you want to find out?</li>
</ul>
<p>A useful tool in creating a research question is the CLIP criteria, which consists of a series of questions that can help you identify the key concepts and ideas for your projects:</p>
<p><strong>C </strong>Client - at whom is the service aimed?</p>
<p><strong>L </strong>Location - where is the service sited?</p>
<p><strong>I</strong> Improvement - what do you want to find out?</p>
<p><strong>P</strong> Professional - who is involved in providing/improving the service?</p>
</div>
<div id="tab-2">
<h2>What makes a good/answerable question?</h2>
<p>Writing a good research question is an important step of the research process and your project, as it informs future searches and aims to produce deliverables and outcomes for your client. As such, it's critical that the questions you formulate allow you to form a methodical argument that answers the problem in focus.</p>

<strong>Activity:</strong> After reviewing the information this page, evaluate your questions to point out areas that might need refining.</div>
<p>The Library has collated a few resources on how to develop good and answerable research questions below, with a brief overview about the key points found in each.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="enhanceable_content tabs ui-tabs-minimal">
<ul>
<li><a style="font-size: 1.05em;" href="#tab-4">CIRT</a></li>
<li><a style="font-size: 1.05em;" href="#tab-5">The Writing Center</a></li>
<li><a style="font-size: 1.05em;" href="#tab-6">Universal Teacher</a></li>
</ul>
<div id="tab-4" style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 10px; font-size: 1.05em;">
<p>The '<a href="https://cirt.gcu.edu/research/developmentresources/tutorials/question">Writing a Good Research Question</a>' resource from the Center for Innovation in Research and Teaching (CIRT) is a fantastic resource that goes through the concepts and ideas to consider when creating an answerable question step by step.</p>
<p>Also included are a few examples of research questions - both good and needing work. By comparing your research question to the information and examples presented in this resource, you'll be able to identify what makes a good question, and evaluate your own.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1oJNO6PYZe4" width="560" height="315" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"></iframe></div>
<div id="tab-5" style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 10px; font-size: 1.05em;">
<p>Similarly, The Writing Center's '<a href="https://writingcenter.gmu.edu/guides/how-to-write-a-research-question">How to Write a Research Question</a>' resource breaks down the concepts behind a good research questions with a bit more depth. This resource also identifies steps such as considering your audience and evaluating your question with accompanying explanations.</p>
<p>Also included are some more sample questions, but unlike the CIRT resource, The Writing Center as an analysis below each one to highlight what does and doesn't work. For example:</p>
<p><strong>Unclear:</strong><em> How should social networking sites address the harm they cause?<br /></em><strong>Clear:</strong><em> What action should social networking sites like MySpace and Facebook take to protect users&rsquo; personal information and privacy?</em><br /><br />The unclear version of this question doesn&rsquo;t specify which social networking sites or suggest what kind of harm the sites might be causing. It also assumes that this &ldquo;harm&rdquo; is proven and/or accepted. The clearer version specifies sites (MySpace and Facebook), the type of potential harm (privacy issues), and who may be experiencing that harm (users). A strong research question should never leave room for ambiguity or interpretation.</p>
</div>
<div id="tab-6" style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 10px; font-size: 1.05em;">
<p>Finally, the '<a href="http://universalteacher.com/1/characteristics-of-a-good-research-question/">Characteristics of a Good Research Question</a>' by Universal Teacher underlines more essential components of good research questions, such as:</p>
<p>"Good research questions demands a lot more than looking something up. It reflects an underlying tension which doesn&rsquo;t merely turn on one or two missing facts. It should force you to weigh evidence and evaluate divergent views on the subject. It should enable you to create a solution that the audience find both interesting and important."</p>
<p>This resource is useful because it frames some of the essential skills in creating a good research question differently from the other two, while including some new ideas.</p>

<h2>Breaking a question down to search</h2>
<div class="ic-flash-info" style="width: 100%;">
<div class="ic-flash__icon" aria-hidden="true"><i class="icon-info icon-Solid"></i></div>
<strong>Activity:</strong> What key terms from your developed research question would you use to search with?</div>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 14.666666984558105px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration: none; display: inline !important; float: none;">Before you begin finding journal articles in a database, it's important to identify the terms you'll use to search. Authors often use different words or phrases to describe the same concept, which means you have to brainstorm alternative terms to include in your search.&nbsp;It is therefore important to think of as many alternative words or phrases as possible to capture all results relevant to your research topic.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 14.666666984558105px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration: none; display: inline !important; float: none;">For each concept, think of the different ways you might refer to that concept. This might mean thinking of synonyms or similar terms (theory OR model), spelling acronyms out in full or vice-verca (ITIL OR "Information Technology Infrastructure Library"), commercial names of generic terms (bitcoin OR cryptocurrency) or naming the more specific term ("programming language" OR Python).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; font-size: 14.666666984558105px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; white-space: normal; text-decoration: none; display: inline !important; float: none;">The video below demonstrates how to use the elements of a question for searching for information:</span></p>

<div style="display: inline-block; border-top: 2px solid #1C4961; margin-top: 10px; background: #1C4961; color: #ffffff; padding: 5px 15px;"><strong>Example: Building a search </strong></div>
<div style="display: inline-block; padding: 10px; border-top: 2px solid #1C4961; margin: 0px; background: #F5F5F5; color: #000000; width: 100%; font-size: 0.9em;">
<p>An alternative to searching using the above approach is to build a search concept by concept. This requires you to run each search separately and then combining them later. This allows you to see the number of results each concept returns and then trialling combinations as you require. The video below shows how you would do it in the database Scopus. Other databases will offer a similar option, but sometimes will require you to select from lines in the search history section of the database rather than the main search page.</p>
<p>There is no sound for this video. You will want to view it in full-screen mode in order to follow along.</p>
