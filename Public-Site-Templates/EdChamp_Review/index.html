      <h2>What is a literature review?</h2>
      <p>A literature review is a critical evaluation of literature published on a particular topic.  In this context, literature refers to sources of high quality written by authors with expertise, and can be in a variety of formats.  These formats commonly include scholarly journal articles, conference papers, books or book-chapters, but can also refer to government publications, theses and dissertations, and depending on your topic, even media reports or websites.</p>
		<h2>What is the purpose of a literature review?</h2>
		<p>Literature reviews:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Provide useful background information to your topic, which enables readers to better understand your topic.</li>
			<li>Demonstrate your knowledge of the subject area.</li>
			<li>Make clear your perspectives on the topic.</li>
			<li>Justify your choice of research design. For instance, your choice of qualitative over quantitative approaches, or your method of data analysis.</li>
			<li>Explain how your work will fill in a gap in the scholarly literature.</li>
		</ul>

      <b>How is a literature review different to an essay?</b><br>
      <p>While literature reviews and essays require many of the same skills – for instance, critical thinking skills, academic writing skills and referencing skills – they have different purposes. Whereas essays require you to support your own arguments, literature reviews require you to critique the arguments of others.</p>

      <b>What about an annotated bibliography?</b><br>
      <p>While literature reviews and annotated bibliographies both require you to summarise sources, literature reviews involve much more than this. Annotated bibliographies are primarily descriptive, whereas literature reviews are primarily analytical.</p>

<p>Literature reviews and annotated bibliographies are also structured differently. Annotated bibliographies are presented in an alphabetical list format, and each reference is treated separately. In contrast, literature reviews synthesise the ideas contained in each reference, and are structured around a central concept divided by subheadings.</p>

        <h2>Characteristics of a literature review</h2>
		  <h2>Focus on key publications</h2>

<p>Literature reviews do not require you to include everything that has been written on your topic. Your focus should be on publications that have made a big impact on the field. If a reference has been cited numerous times by other reputable authors, it is fair to assume that it is a key publication. It is also important to include recent publications to show that you are up to date with ideas and developments in the field.</p>

<h2>Look at the ‘big picture’</h2>
<p>Although literature reviews often involve analysing small details of a reference, it is important to always keep your eye on the big picture. Make sure you provide a comprehensive overview of the topic for your readers – point out who the leading theorists are, what the key publications have been, and any gaps in the research (areas that have been neglected by researchers). Writing a literature review is like assembling a puzzle –you need to figure out how each piece fits together as well as whether there are any missing pieces. It is only by completing the puzzle that the overall topic becomes clear. </p>

<h2>Say something new!</h2>
<p>When writing a literature review it is important to say something new about your topic. Either examine a topic that has never been written about before (this is quite rare) or look at an old topic in a new way. No one will be interested in your literature review if it simply rehashes old knowledge.</p>

<h2>State your contribution to the literature</h2>
<p>It is not enough to critically evaluate the literature – you must make clear how your interpretation of the literature extends and enriches our understanding of the topic. This step is the one most often neglected by researchers.

      <h2>What is meant by the term review?</h2>
      <p>Literature refers to a collection of published information/materials on a particular area of reserach or topic, such as books and journal articles of academic value. However, your literature review does not need to be inclusive of every article and bookn that has been written on your topic because that will be too broad. Rather, it should include the <b>key sources</b> related to the main debates, trends and gaps in your research area.</p>
